# Hi all, I'm Gaurish ![enter image description here](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44b.png)
## About me
I am currently pursing my Ph.D. at the [Faculty of humanities and social sciences, University of Zagreb](https://web2020.ffzg.unizg.hr/). I have Bachelors in Computer Engineering and Masters in Natural Language Processing. I work as an early-stage researcher at the University of London for the EU-funded Horizon 2020 project [CLEOPATRA](http://cleopatra-project.eu/), under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network. I have 5+ industry experience and have worked as full-stack web-developer as well as data science engineer. 

## My research
My research mainly focuses on cross-lingual sentiment analysis for low-resourced languages. I am interested in testing the limitations of cross-lingual supervision transfer in zero-shot as well as few-shot settings. I am part of Institute of Linguistics and being jointly guided by Dr. Nives Mikelić Preradović (FFZG),  Dr Marko Tadić (FFZG) and Jeremy Barnes (University of Oslo).
